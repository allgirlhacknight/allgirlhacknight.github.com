		<h1><span>Austin</span> All-Girl Hack Night</h1>
		<p class="about">A meetup for women developers the 2nd Wednesday of every month at ActiveProspect. <a href="">➙</a></p>
		<p class="aboutlong"> 
			Our goal is to help women in our field find each other to make friends, work on projects, and share knowledge. We have talks by women working on interesting things in many niches, followed by time to work collaboratively, ending with an optional laptops-closed social event at a nearby bar.<br/> 
			If you're a woman who writes code, we'd love to have you join us!</p>

			<h2><span>this month:</span>Build a Development Environment</h2>
			<p class="datetime">August 22th, 2014 ★ 7pm ★ at <a href="http://www.capitalfactory.com/">Capital Factory</a></p>
			<p>Before you start a development project, you need to create an environment on your computer to let you code in your chosen language or technology stack. For example, you might need to install a language such as Ruby or Python, a webserver or a database, build tools or certain libraries. Sometimes the installation and configuration process is not straightforward. So let’s meet and figure out how to build various development environments.</p>
			<p>This event will be just a week before the second SheHacksATX hackathon. If you are participating in it, there is a chance that the environment you build will be useful to you at the hackathon -- or at least you’ll have skills to build one at/before the hackathon. Those not participating in SheHacksATX are welcome too! </p>
			<p>RSVP at our meetup.com <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Austin-All-Girl-Hack-Night/events/198231482/">event page</a>.</p>
			<p>We are looking for experienced developers (female or male) to help us! If you can spare 2 hours on a Friday evening helping novice developers set up their environments, please let us know at <span style="color: #1b7778">allgirlhacknite@gmail.com</span>. Some languages and frameworks we are looking for is Ruby (with or without Rails), Python, Django, PHP and its frameworks, but we are not limited to those.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Austin/">Girl Develop It</a></h3>
                <p class="datetime">Recurring ★ various dates and locations</p>
                <p>Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it. It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask "stupid questions." We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites). Stay tuned to this meetup for upcoming scheduled classes.</p>
