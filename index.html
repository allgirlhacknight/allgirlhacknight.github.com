		<h1><span>Austin</span> All-Girl Hack Night</h1>
		<p class="about">A meetup for women developers the 4th Wednesday of every month at Capital Factory. <a href="">➙</a></p>
		<p class="aboutlong"> 
			Our goal is to help women in our field find each other to make friends, work on projects, and share knowledge. We have talks by women working on interesting things in many niches, followed by time to work collaboratively, ending with an optional laptops-closed social event at a nearby bar.<br/> 
			If you're a woman who writes code, we'd love to have you join us!</p>

			<h2><span>this month:</span>Dramatic Teenage Code Readings</h2>
			<p class="datetime">February 27, 2013 ★ 7pm ★ <a href="http://www.capitalfactory.com/">Capital Factory</a></p>
			<img src="img/geocities.jpg" alt="Geocities logo on a t-shirt" />
			<p>It's a short month, so instead of a mind-blowing talk, we're doing something a little more interactive. We'll be doing dramatic readings of our first code. The worse it is, the better! So dig up those Hello Worlds, those Geocities pages, those Flash games, those Java applets, and bring them along to hold them up to the purifying light of heavy irony. They say if you don't hate your old code you're not learning, so let's laugh about arcane "best" practices and talk about how those first steps took us to where we are now.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Austin/">Girl Develop It</a></h3>
                <p class="datetime">Recurring ★ various dates and locations</p>
                <p>Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it. It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask "stupid questions." We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites). Stay tuned to this meetup for upcoming scheduled classes.</p>
