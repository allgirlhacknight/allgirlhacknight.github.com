                <h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Austin/">Girl Develop It</a></h3>
                <p class="datetime">Recurring ★ various dates and locations</p>
                <p>Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it. It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask "stupid questions." We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites). Stay tuned to this meetup for upcoming scheduled classes.</p>
